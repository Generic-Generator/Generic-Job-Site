# Generic-Job-Site

Devoloping an MVP for a Job Search site since I have been on quite a few and have ideas for improvement.

Deployed Demo: [DEMO](http://52.21.107.140:3004/)

Features Walkthrough.

"login" screen explians this is a demo of the front end and contains a field to input a user id. This is in preparation for authentication, which would spit out a user id only for sercurity purposes. I have white listed digits 0-9 and an alert will appear if a value that is not all digits is entered in the field. This will be kept to a front end demo until I am sure I can handle most security concerns. This may also stay a front end only demo since the only charges I've had so far came from data transfers with a deployed database.

Once "logged in" you can see the job posting page. You can also see jobs applied for by clicking the view jobs applied to button. A message will display letting you know if there are no jobs when there are none applied to, none match the search, or you have applied to all jobs.

The search feature starts filtering jobs based on title and description when the term reaches a length of 3 charactors. There is also a drop down to filter by years of experience, which works with the search term to filter results. If the experience filter is applied results are sorted by jobs requiring the most experience first.

I hope this demo was more entertaining to evaluate my skills than just watching a video.
